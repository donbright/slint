## simple examples - hello6

Button example. This will show the basics of the built-in Button widget.
This example is completely in slint. 

This displays the text "Hello Button!" in a button. 

When you press the button, it should change color. This may be slight
and hard to notice depending on the slint Style and backend. Hold down
on the button longer to see it really change.

To run, use slint-viewer:

    slint-viewer hello6.slint
