## simple examples - hello5
#
# Rust reads a Property from a Slint widget, then prints out the value.
# 
# The example will show a slint window with Hello World 5!, however it 
# will also display on the Standard Output (command line) a text similar 
# to the following:
#
#   Hello World 5! This text is from Slint, but being displayed from Rust!
