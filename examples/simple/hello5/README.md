## simple examples - hello5
#
# In this example we are transmitting data from Slint to Rust.
# 
# This is accomplished again with a Global Singleton, using
# an "out" property in the .slint code
#
# The example will show a slint window with Hello World 5!, however it 
# will also display on the Standard Output (command line) a text similar 
# to the following:
#
#   Hello World 5! This text is from Slint, but being displayed from Rust!
